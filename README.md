# Application of Sales Report - Flutter
This application is an application that I use in working on my thesis. This application is specifically for a palm oil company. The application is designed using the DART language with the Flutter framework. This app can be used for both admins and users. This application serves for an admin (buyer) to record the purchase of palm fruit from a user (seller / farmer). 

For the admin side, this application can be used as a purchase recording like CRUD in general. Admin can see all purchase transactions that they have made. Admins can see a list of all transactions each date included with the total of those transactions. The admin is also the one who registers farmers who use this application. Unlike users (the farmer), they can only see transactions related to the user himself. They can't manage transaction data.
